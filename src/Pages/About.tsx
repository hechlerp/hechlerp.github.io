                            Welcome to my site! I'm Peter Hechler, a game developer based out of New York City. I've been coding professionally for around 7 years now,
                            and until recently worked as a Front End Web Developer. I've been programming and designing a larger scale RTS in my spare time over the last few years, as well as
                            building a number of smaller-scale games.
                            <br />

                <Typography className="bio">
                    You can find the games I've made here on my site, on the <Link href="/games" onClick={handleLinkNav}>Games page</Link>. They include my personal projects and a few choice games I worked on as part of game jams.
